# BXSwiftUI

This framework/package provides lots of missing stuff that was missing in SwiftUI 1.0. This is useful for those developers who want to deploy their app all the way back to macOS Catalina.

Documentation is so far non-existant. Check out the source code documentation for hints of usage.
